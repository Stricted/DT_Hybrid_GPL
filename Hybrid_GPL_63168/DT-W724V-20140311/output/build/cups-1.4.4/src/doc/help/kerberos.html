<H1 CLASS="title">Using Kerberos Authentication</H1>

<P>CUPS allows you to use a Key Distribution Center (KDC) for authentication
on your local CUPS server and when printing to a remote authenticated queue.
This document describes how to configure CUPS to use Kerberos authentication
and provides links to the MIT help pages for configuring Kerberos on your
systems and network.</P>


<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="REQUIREMENTS">System Requirements</A></H2>

<p>The following are required to use Kerberos with CUPS:</p>

<ol>

	<li>Heimdal Kerberos (any version) or MIT Kerberos (1.6.3 or newer)</li>

	<li>Properly configured Domain Name System (DNS)
	infrastructure:<ol type='a'>
		<li>DNS server(s) with static IP addresses for all CUPS clients
		and servers or configured to allow DHCP updates to the host
		addresses</li>
		<li>All CUPS clients and servers configured to use the same
		DNS server(s)</li>
	</ol></li>

	<li>Properly configured Kerberos infrastructure:<ol type='a'>
		<li>KDC configured to allow CUPS clients and servers to obtain
		Service Granting Tickets (SGTs) for the "ipp" service</li>
		<li>LDAP-based user accounts - both OpenDirectory and
		ActiveDirectory provide this with the KDC</li>
		<li>CUPS clients and servers bound to the KDC and LDAP
		server(s)</li>
	</ol></li>

	<li>An "ipp" Service Granting Ticket (SGT) for every CUPS client and
	server</li>

</ol>


<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="KRB5">Configuring Kerberos on Your System</A></H2>

<P>Before you can use Kerberos with CUPS, you will need to configure
Kerberos on your system and setup a system as a KDC. Because this
configuration is highly system and site-specific, please consult
the following on-line resources provided by the creators of Kerberos
at the Massachussetts Institute of Technology (MIT):</P>

	Authentication Protocol</A></LI>

	<LI><A HREF="http://web.mit.edu/macdev/KfM/Common/Documentation/faq-osx.html">Kerberos
	on Mac OS X Frequently Asked Questions</A></LI>

</UL>

<P>The Linux Documentation Project also has a HOWTO on Kerberos:</P>

<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="CUPS">Configuring CUPS to Use Kerberos</A></H2>

<P>Once you have configured Kerberos on your system(s), you can then
enable Kerberos authentication by selecting the <tt>Negotiate</tt>
authentication type. The simplest way to do this is using the
<tt>cupsctl(8)</tt> command:</P>

<PRE CLASS="command">
<KBD>cupsctl DefaultAuthType=Negotiate</KBD>
</PRE>

<P>You can also enable Kerberos from the web interface by checking the
<VAR>Use Kerberos Authentication</VAR> box and clicking <VAR>Change
Settings</VAR>:</P>

<PRE CLASS="command">
http://localhost:631/admin
</PRE>

<P>After you have enabled Kerberos authentication, use the built-in
"authenticated" policy or your own custom policies with the printers you
will be sharing. See <a href="policies.html">Managing Operation Policies</a>
for more information.</P>


<H2 CLASS="title"><A NAME="IMPLEMENT">Implementation Information</A></H2>

<P>CUPS implements Kerberos over HTTP using GSSAPI and the service name
"host". Because of limitations in the HTTP GSSAPI protocol extension, only
a single domain/KDC is supported for authentication.</P>

<P>When doing printing tasks that require authentication, CUPS requests a
single-use "ticket" from your login session to authenticate who you are.
This ticket gives CUPS a username of the form "user@REALM", which is then
converted to just "user" for purposes of user and group checks.</P>

<P>In order to support printing to a shared printer, CUPS has to ask the KDC
for a copy of your credentials (this is called delegation) that can be sent to
the remote server for authenticatation. Delegation only works when the system
has a stable hostname which maps to the current address of the system, which
is why you need a static IP address or DHCP that updates the DNS entry for your
system.</P>
