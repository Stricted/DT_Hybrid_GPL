A specific README located in the "./help" directory exists
for each supported platforms. This is the definitive place
to find informations about specific platforms.

Note that osip is developped on a i386 linux and other architecture
might be broken. Reports if one appears broken.

Common Install process for UNIX.

  $> tar -xvzf libosip-x.x.x.tar.gz
  $> mkdir bld-linux
  $> CFLAGS="-I/usr/local/include/" ../configure
  $> make
  $> make install      (as root...)

I prefer to do:

  $> tar -xvzf libosip-0.X.X.tar.gz
  $> mkdir linux-build
  $> cd linux-build
  $> ../libosip-0.X.X/configure
  $> make
  $> make install

Here is a list of options you can give to the 'configure' command line:

configure --disable-mt             ==> disable any thread support,
flags: "-UOSIP_MT"

configure --disable-debug          ==> disable debug.
flags: "-UENABLE_DEBUG"

configure --disable-trace          ==> disable the trace in the logfile.
flags: "-UENABLE_TRACE"

configure --prefix=/your/local     ==> install in '$prefix' (default is /usr/local)
