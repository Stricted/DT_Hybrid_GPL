"The GNU oSIP library" is part of the "GNU project".
You  can  check www.fsf.org for more information about
being part of the "GNU project".

This is "the GNU oSIP library". It has been designed
to provide the Internet Community a  simple  way  to
support the  Session  Initiation  Protocol.  SIP  is
described in  the  RFC3261  which  is  available  at
http://www.ietf.org/rfc/rfc3261.txt.


FEATURES: (version 2.0.9)
---------

The oSIP library consists of 2 parts:

PARSER:
  *  SIP URL parser.
  *  SIP message parser. (and accessor API)
  *  SDP message parser. (and accessor API)
  *  MIME support for message with multiple attachments.

TRANSACTION LAYER:
  *  2 states machines for "client transaction" (INVITE and other).
  *  2 states machines for "server transaction"
  *  user controls the application with events.
  *  events managed by the oSIP stack are announced through callbacks.
  *  A SDP framework for quick negotiation. (for UAC/UAS only)
  *  dialog handling facility. (for UAC/UAS only)
  *  timers management framework.

EXTRA:
  *  Porting osip is easy. You probably only have to modify
	./src/osipparser2/osip_port.c
	./src/osip2/port_fifo.c
	./src/osip2/port_sema.c
	./src/osip2/port_thread.c
	./include/osipparser2/osip_port.h
     Please redistribute your ports to jack@atosc.org.

  *  oSIP is not tight to any design! You can use the library
     either in a multi-threaded environment or not, use your
     own interruption's mechanism for timer, or use your own
     transport protocol.

Installation procedure:
-----------------------

The library is known to compile on various platform:
  *  GNU/Linux
  *  OpenBsd 3.1/3.2  // (FreeBSD&NetBSD should also work)
  *  Windows NT/95/2000 (VC++6.0 or cygwin)

  *  VxWorks.
  *  Some embedded systems with linux.

For more informations about compilation, please look in
the ./help directory.

Tests programs:
---------------

The library contains some built-in test for the parser. To quickly test
the parser, type: (Note that some tests MUST fail!)

  $> make check

Watch out the ./src/test/README file for more informations.
