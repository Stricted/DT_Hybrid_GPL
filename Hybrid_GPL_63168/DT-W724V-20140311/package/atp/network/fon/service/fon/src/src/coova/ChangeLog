* Renamed and swapped meaning of config param ''uamsuccess'' (mentioned below) to ''nouamsuccess'' which defaults to ''off'' for compatibility - turn on this feature to ''not'' return the user to the UAM server on login, but their original url instead.

== ChangeLog (CoovaChilli-v1.0.1 svn revision 2) ==

* Added the ability to use ''include <filename>'' in configuration files to include others. Using gengetopt version 2.16 and a patch is applied to the generated source.
* A ''chilli_radconfig'' utility to perform a NAS Administrative-User RADIUS login in order to collect configurations (using the new ChilliSpot-Config VSA).
* A ''chilli_query'' utility to interface directly with the chilli server (via a UNIX socket) and retrieve the status of all DHCP leases and sessions. Also, the utility can be used to instruct chilli to release a DHCP lease (and logout the user).
* Added the configuration parameters ''adminuser'' and ''adminpasswd'' which are used by ''chilli_radconfig'' in combination with the other RADIUS (server, secret, port) parameters.
* Fixed the handling of the originally requested URL and the forwarding of said in the UAM initial redirect query string (parameter ''userurl'').
* Passing query string argument ''loginurl'' to ''uamhomepage'' noting the URL to follow to login -- also making the redirect return WISPr directions to use the uamserver URL instead.
* Added the configuration parameter ''wwwdir'' which defines a directory which will serve local files for URLs of format: ''http://<uamlisten>:<uamport>/www/<filename>'' - only supports ''.html'', ''.gif'', and ''.jpg'' extensions.
* Added the configuration parameters ''dhcpstart'', and ''dhcpend'' which define the DHCP ippool range.
* Added the sending of ''hisip'' in the UAM initial redirect query string.
* Added the configuration parameter ''cmdsocket'' which is the path of the UNIX socket to use for chilli_query.
* Added the configuration parameter ''ssid'' which gets added to the UAM initial redirect query string.
* Added the configuration parameter ''vlan'' which gets added to the UAM initial redirect query string.
* Added the configuration parameter ''nasip'' which gets used in the RADIUS NAS-IP-Address attribute (the listen IP is used if not set).
* Added the configuration parameter ''nasmac'' which gets sent to the UAM server in the initial redirect query string as called.
* Added the configuration parameter ''uamwispr'' which turns off and on chilli's internal support for WISPr XML (turned off by default as it is assumed the back-office is driving the XML).
* Added the configuration parameter ''uamsuccess'' which turns off and on whether or not chilli will send the user back to the UAM server (instead of their original URL) once authenticated.
* Swapped input/output octets/packets in RADIUS to be more in-line with other WiFi gateways.
* Allocates "app connections" on demand instead of in bulk to reduce memory usage.
* Rearranged some code to improve the building process and reduce the memory footprint of the additional utilities.
* (Re)Configuration memory leak fixed.
