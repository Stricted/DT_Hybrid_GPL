#
hostname = localhost:25

# Set the user name

# Same as above but for a different identity which can be selected with the
# '-f' flag. You can have as many you like.
#
identity = myself@somewhere.com
	hostname = smtp.somewhere.com:25
	username = "myself"
	password = "secret"
	#starttls = disabled

# Everything (username, password, etc.) must be specified for every identity
# even if they don't differ from the default identity.

#
mda = "/usr/bin/procmail -d %T"
